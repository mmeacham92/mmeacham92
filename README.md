### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- âš¡ I'm a software engineer with >5 years of experience based just outside of Nashville, Tennesee. Technologies I've built with include HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ReactJS, Java, C#, frameworks including .NET Core MVC and Entity, along with both relational databases and RDBMS
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently teaching Java while also building some pretty cool projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin and Android development with my end goal being to not only learn a new skill, but also to     begin deploying apps to the Google Play store
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about projects ideas I'm working on and Kotlin! The best way to learn is to teach!
